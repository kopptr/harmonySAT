\paragraph{Things I Did}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finished implementation of Adaptive portion of the solver.
\item Built a benchmark functionality into the solver
\item Found some instances that wouldn't time out.
\item Ran benches, built adaptive input
\item Tried adaptive - used both given and learned to decide distance
\item Tried adaptive - used learned to decide distance
\item
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item New formulas --- Found a bunch, as well as a handful of ones that are application.
\item generate random formulas --- Mitsuo Motoki --- generate soln,
then generate consistent
clauses\footnote{\url{
   http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/~watanabe/gensat/a1/index.html}}.
\item clause:variable ratio of 4.2 --- only applies to 3SAT
\item SAT Competition winner determination --- 2 stages. Stage 1, selection by
jury. Second stage has longer timeout (5000s). Winner is the most formulas
solved. Ties broken by cumulative time. Separate rankings for wall clock time
and cpu time.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{ToDo}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement L1 Norm. Compare \& contrast.
\item Implement adaptive solver timing itself using the same mechanism as the
benchmarks.
\item Change solver to make pretty table
\item Find more instances with differing Stats and that don't time out.
\item Optimize the configurations individually?
\end{itemize}
